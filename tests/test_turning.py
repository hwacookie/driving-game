        Args:
            direction: "left" or "right"
            duration: Maximum time to monitor (seconds)
            target_speed: Target speed in km/h
            start_point: If given, teleport to this deterministic named start
                point (synthetic test map) instead of a random location.
            expected_end_segment: If given, the test only PASSES if the car
                ends up on exactly this segment - not just "any segment
                change" (which would silently pass even if e.g. a LEFT
                turn actually went RIGHT, as long as it went somewhere -
                this is exactly the kind of bug that slipped through
                before the API-blinker-routing fix). Monitoring keeps
                running across MULTIPLE segment changes (e.g. a
                roundabout: entry -> ring -> ring -> exit) until the car
                has driven to the 50% point of this exact segment
                (mid-segment, mirroring the mid-segment START - the far
                end / parking tail is NOT part of a turn test), a
                violation occurs, or duration runs out. If None (only used
                for the legacy random-location suite, where there's no way
                to know the correct answer in advance), falls back to the
                old "any change + drive to the far end and stop" behavior.
            start_progress: Where along the start segment to spawn (0..1
                from the named node). The suite standard is 0.5; the
                parking-offset scenarios use 0.15 so there is ~100 m of
                approach between spawn and the flag at 50%.
            kerb_check: Parking-offset scenarios only (docs/
                DRIVING_MANEUVERS.md §1 variant). The arrival at the flag
                is not enough - BOTH right-hand wheels must end within
                KERB_PASS_MAX_M of the right kerb or the scenario fails.
            end_flag_progress: Where along the expected end segment the
                red end flag sits (0..1 from the segment's first node).
                Suite standard is END_FLAG_PROGRESS (first 20%); a
                scenario may override it (e.g. test 12 finishes at the
                50% point of the end segment).
            abort_check: Optional zero-arg callable, polled throughout setup
                and monitoring. If it returns truthy, the scenario is
                ABORTED right away (the cockpit controller sets this when
                the user clicks a different test button): inputs are
                cleared and an 'aborted' result is returned - NOT recorded
                in turning_results.json, since the scenario was never

    """Run turn tests.
    
    By default, runs the DETERMINISTIC suite against the synthetic
    'basic' test map (start the game with: --map basic --api).
    
    Pass --tests <spec> to run a subset by number/name (see select_tests),
    e.g. `--tests fig8_stress` for just the multi-car stress scenario.

    The stress scenario additionally honours --stress-cars N[,N...] to run
    only specific car counts (e.g. `--stress-cars 576`); each phase then
    covers STRESS_PHASE_SECONDS of sim time, so a slow-motion sim simply
    takes longer in wall clock.

    Pass --random to instead teleport to random locations on whatever
    map is currently loaded (real OSM data or a test map).
    
    Pass --only <start_point> <direction> <speed_kmh> [end_segment] to run
    a SINGLE scenario directly instead of the whole suite (much faster when
    debugging one known-failing case):

        python tests/test_turning.py --only corner_right_entry right 120 6

    With end_segment, the red end flag is set at that segment's first 20%
    point as a VISUAL-ONLY marker (the running turn-test protocol, exactly
    like the full suite) - without it the nav has no destination and
    therefore no parking plan (no reverse-in).
