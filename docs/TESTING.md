# How Testing Works Here

Testing has two layers:

1. **Headless pytest suites** (`tests/test_obstacles.py`,
   `tests/test_road_network.py`) - no game process, no window, no REST
   server: they build the road network and car directly in-process and
   assert on placement rules, collision geometry, stop-on-contact
   physics, layout save/load, and the obstacle REST handlers (via
   Flask's test client). They run in seconds and are the first thing to
   run after a change:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_obstacles.py tests/test_road_network.py -q
   ```
2. **Live e2e suite** (the rest of this document) - the running game
   exposes a REST API, and test scripts drive the actual game (actual
   physics, actual rendering, actual road network) from the outside,
   exactly like a human or another program would: `tests/test_turning.py`
   for the turning scenarios, `scripts/verify_obstacles_live.py` for the
   obstacle stop-on-contact scenario.

See `docs/REST_API.md` for the full endpoint reference; this document
focuses on the *testing workflow* itself.

## 1. Start the game with the API enabled

```bash
python -m src.main --map basic --api
```

- `--map basic` loads the synthetic **test map** (`src/test_maps.py`) -
  a small, fully known/deterministic road network purpose-built for
  testing every kind of turn/junction (see "The test map" below).
  Without `--map`, the game loads real OSM data instead, which is fine
  for manual play but not useful for deterministic tests (no fixed,
  named start points).
- `--api` starts a Flask server on `http://localhost:5000` in a
  background thread.
- Since M5 the sim is **always headless** - there is no pygame anywhere
  in the package. The 60 Hz game loop paces itself with a hybrid
  sleep+spin (plain `time.sleep` overshoots ~50% on this platform, which
  would drag the sim to ~43 fps), and all visualization lives in the
  Godot frontend (`/Users/hauke/prj/driving-game/`), which polls
  `GET /state` at ~60 Hz. A test script hitting the API is really just
  remote-controlling (and reading state from) the same live sim the
  Godot window renders.

### Watching a run

Start the sim, then start the Godot frontend in a second terminal:

```bash
python -m src.main --map basic --api
# second terminal:
/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/hauke/prj/driving-game
```

The window shows the map, the car (sprite, blinkers, wheel breadcrumbs),
the test flags and the HUD label - and mirrors the sim's camera. This is
genuinely useful for debugging: you can literally watch the car take a
turn while a test script asserts on the exact same state.

## 2. Run the test suite against it

In a second terminal (the game keeps running in the first):

```bash
python tests/test_turning.py
```

This is the main test script. It:
1. Confirms the API is reachable (`GET /health`).
2. Fetches the map's named start points (`GET /start_points`).
3. For each test scenario: teleports a fresh car to a known start point
   (`POST /teleport {"start_point": ..., "progress": 0.8, "speed": ...}`)
   - in the LAST 20% of the start segment, laterally in the middle of the
   rightmost lane, already rolling at 50 km/h (the running turn-test
   protocol, see §3) - arms a turn signal or none (`POST /control
   {"blinker_left"/"blinker_right": true}`), holds the accelerator down
   (`POST /control {"accelerate": true}`), and then polls `GET /state`
   every ~50ms until the car crosses the red end flag (first 20% of the
   expected end segment) or the monitor window expires, watching for:
   - **off-road violations** (`state['on_road'] == False`)
   - **wrong-side driving** (`state['wrong_side'] == True` - the car is on
     the oncoming half of a two-way road; fails the scenario immediately,
     see §3)
   - **instant heading snaps** (>30° heading change in one frame - a
     physics bug, not a real turn)
   - whether the car actually changed to the expected next road segment
4. Prints a pass/fail summary.

### Selecting scenarios

```bash
python tests/test_turning.py --tests 3            # one, by number
python tests/test_turning.py --tests 3,7-9        # several, or a range
python tests/test_turning.py --tests y_from_stem  # every scenario there
python tests/test_turning.py --failed             # whatever failed last run
python tests/test_turning.py --failfast           # stop at the first failure
```

Numbering is preserved when filtering, so "TEST 7/18" always identifies the
same scenario - the point being to jump straight back to one that failed.

Test maps do NOT auto-spawn a car: the sim starts with no car
(`GET /state` reports `has_car: false`) and the suite's setup teleport
creates the car at the scenario's start point before any driving. An
explicit `--start <name>` still places a car at that named point (e.g.
for manual observation); real OSM data keeps its random spawn.

### Running a single scenario

Debugging one specific case is much faster than the whole suite:

```bash
python tests/test_turning.py --only corner_right_entry right 80
python tests/test_turning.py --only corner_right_entry right 80 6   # + destination
```

`--only <start_point> <direction> <speed_kmh> [end_segment]` teleports
straight to that one start point, arms that one turn direction (or
`straight`), and monitors just that one turn. `speed_kmh` is only "how
fast to get up to before we start watching" (the driver always tries to
accelerate to top speed and brakes only as needed for the upcoming turn -
see the speed profile in `src/bicycle_nav.py`, which derives cornering
speed from the curvature of the driving line); it does not force a
specific cruising or cornering speed.

The optional `[end_segment]` sets the red end flag at that segment's FIRST
20% point as a VISUAL-ONLY marker (`red_nav: false`) - the car drives
through it and the run ends on the crossing, exactly like the full
suite's running turn tests. Without it the nav has no destination at all:
the car just drives through. To watch a parking maneuver live in the
Godot window, run one of the parking-offset scenarios from the suite instead
(`python tests/test_turning.py --tests park_6lane_right_lane`): only those
set the flag as the nav's destination and trigger the full parking
approach (including reverse-in where the geometry calls for it).

### Cockpit controller (`tools/controller.py`)

The driver's cockpit is a **separate window** (its own process, its own
pygame) that talks to the game over the same REST API - the Godot frontend
stays a pure world view. It shows the dashboard (speed, lamps,
OFF-ROAD / WRONG-SIDE warnings, fed by `GET /state`) plus one of two panels:

```bash
python tools/controller.py                 # TEST mode (default): runs the suite
python tools/controller.py --tests 1-3     # ...but only those scenarios
python tools/controller.py --drive         # DRIVE mode: manual driving console
```

- **TEST mode** shows a row of numbered scenario buttons (1..N, same
  numbering as `--tests`). Clicking a button - or typing its number and
  pressing Enter - **aborts the current test and starts that one**, then
  continues with the rest. Buttons turn green/red as scenarios pass/fail;
  aborted runs are reported separately in the summary and never recorded in
  `turning_results.json`. The suite output goes to the console exactly as
  with `test_turning.py`, so the usual `| tee /tmp/test_run.log` workflow
  applies.
- **DRIVE mode** is a manual driving console for FREE mode: hold-buttons
  for steering/gas/brake plus one-shot blinker stalks, hazard and U-turn -
  mouse or keyboard (arrows/WASD, Q/E, H, U). `F` switches the game between
  AI (BICYCLE) and manual (FREE) via `POST /toggle`. Both panels feed the
  same `POST /control` channel the test runner uses.

`python tests/test_turning.py` remains the headless/CI way to run the suite;
the cockpit is the visible, interactive one.

### Random-location mode

```bash
python tests/test_turning.py --random
```

Teleports to random points on whichever map is actually loaded (works
against real OSM data too, unlike the deterministic named-start-point
suite) and repeats the same monitoring at a few speeds. Useful as a
broader smoke test once the deterministic suite passes.

## 3. Pass criteria (deterministic scenarios)

A deterministic scenario is a tuple `(start_point, direction, target_speed,
expected_end_segment, duration)` from `DETERMINISTIC_TESTS`. There are two
protocols:

**Running turn tests** (every scenario except the parking-offset ones):
the intent is to see whether the car does the TURN correctly - nothing
else. The runner teleports a fresh car into the LAST 20% of the start
segment (progress `TURN_SPAWN_PROGRESS` = 0.8), laterally in the middle of
the rightmost lane, already ROLLING at `RUNNING_START_KMH` (50 km/h) - no
standstill-to-cruise phase. The red end flag marks the FIRST 20% of
`expected_end_segment` (`END_FLAG_PROGRESS`) and is VISUAL ONLY: the
`POST /flags` payload carries `red_nav: false`, so the flag does NOT become
the nav's destination - no parking plan, no stop. The test ends when the
car crosses the flag; "passed" means it did the turn without leaving the
road (criteria below). Decision 2026-08-27: tests must be fast, and
parking is covered by the dedicated parking scenarios - not bolted onto
every turn.

**Parking-offset scenarios** (`kerb_check` = true, tests 16-20,
DRIVING_MANEUVERS.md §1 variant): the only scenarios that still park. The
runner spawns the car at 15% of the segment in one of five lateral start
positions (baked into the named start points, from ~0.2 m at the right kerb
to ~0.2 m at the left kerb), and the red flag at 50% is the nav's
DESTINATION (`red_nav: true`): the car must execute the full parking
approach (parking ramp + kerb drift, plus reverse-in where the geometry
calls for it) and end with BOTH right-hand wheels within `KERB_PASS_MAX_M`
(30 cm) of the right kerb.

A scenario **passes** only if ALL of these hold:

1. **Arrival.** Running tests: the car crosses the end flag (first 20% of
   `expected_end_segment`) - at any speed, no stop required. Parking
   tests: the car comes to REST AT the flag (50% point): either it stops
   within `STOP_AT_FLAG_TOLERANCE_M` (8 m) before the flag, or it crosses
   the flag at crawl speed (≤ `FLAG_CRAWL_KMH`, 5 km/h) and then stops.
   Driving PAST the flag while moving is a FAILURE for parking tests
   ("drove past the end flag") - parking at the destination is part of that
   test, not an afterthought.

   **Reverse-in exception.** When the nav plans a back-in park (`/state`
   reports `parking.style == "reverse"`), the car deliberately drives PAST
   the flag: it stages the manoeuvre by stopping several metres beyond it,
   then reverses into the spot at the kerb (DRIVING_MANEUVERS.md §1b). While
   that plan is active and not yet complete, crossing the flag is NOT a
   "drove past" failure, and the staging stop does NOT count as an arrival:
   the run only passes once `/state` reports `parking.parked == true` with
   the car at rest at the flag. The suite reads this from the `parking`
   field of `GET /state` (`{style, phase, parked, reversing}`, sourced from
   the nav in `src/main.py`) - note it must be read from the nav object,
   not the driver, which does not carry these attributes.
2. **Correct route.** The car ends on exactly `expected_end_segment` (a left
   turn that actually went right fails even if it "arrives" somewhere).
3. **No off-road / no wrong-side.** No validator violations (the car must
   stay on the carriageway), and no crossing of the centerline into the
   oncoming lane. The game only WARNS on a wrong-side hit (once per
   crossing) and reports it via `GET /state` (`wrong_side` true on every
   affected frame + cumulative `lane_guard_stats`); failing the run is the
   suite's job: it fails the scenario immediately when a poll sees
   `wrong_side`, with the lane-guard frame counter (delta over the
   scenario) as backstop for hits between polls. The guard itself stays
   silent where crossing the centerline is INTENDED by the maneuver:
   active turn blend zones and on-site U-turns (DRIVING_MANEUVERS.md §5:
   crossing the Mittellinie is "erlaubt und erwartet"). A scenario that
   must cross for a reason (e.g. passing a parked car on a narrow road)
   needs an explicit per-scenario opt-out - not the default.

   **Negative detector test.** The last scenario in `DETERMINISTIC_TESTS`
   is a negative test: it replays the old 80%-spawn `hairpin_exit` config,
   where the car provably slides into the oncoming lane at the tip of the
   V (too close + too fast to make the ~166° turn). It PASSES when the
   wrong-side detection fires and FAILS if the car stays in its own lane -
   it proves the detector works. It runs last so a full run always ends
   with every real driving scenario tested first.
4. **No instant heading snaps.** ≤ 30° per frame (physically impossible
   rotation).
5. **No teleport/jump.** Movement between polls is physically plausible:
   distance ≤ speed × time + margin.
6. **Game stays alive.** The API answers throughout the scenario.
7. **Within the window.** Arrival within the scenario's monitor window
   (default 30 s; `s_curve` and roundabout 40 s - see the table). Passing
   tests exit on arrival, so the window only bounds how long a FAILING run
   takes.

User-aborted runs (cockpit jump) are neither pass nor fail: they are
reported separately and not persisted to `tests/turning_results.json`.

For parking tests, criterion 1 is strict on purpose, and it is satisfied by
the CAR itself: the red flag is the nav's destination
(`BicycleNav.set_destination`), so the car parks at the flag with the
documented parking approach (parking ramp + kerb drift + stop). The
runner's anticipatory brake latch is only a safety net for when that
approach fails. If the car crosses the flag anyway, that is a real driving
defect - e.g. the nav ignoring the hard brake while in pull-over mode (this
is exactly what used to happen on `s_curve`, which parked at the dead end
beyond the flag) - not a test artifact.

## 4. The test map (`src/test_maps.py`)

`build_basic_test_map()` builds a small synthetic grid (see its
docstring for the full layout) with one specific, deliberately named
test scenario per tile: a plain straight road, a 90° corner (both
directions), a T-junction, a Y-intersection, a 4-way crossroads, a
one-way street through a junction, an S-curve, a dead end, a tight
hairpin, a wide sweeping curve, and a roundabout.

Every scenario has one or more **named start points**
(`RoadNetwork.start_points`, set up via `MapBuilder.start(name,
node_id)`), each a fixed `(x, y, heading, segment, forward)` tuple -
that's what makes `--only <start_point> ...` and the deterministic
suite reproducible: no randomness, no "it happened to spawn somewhere
different this time."

`GET /start_points` returns all of them (name → position/heading/
segment/forward) - handy for exploring what's available:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/start_points | python3 -m json.tool
```

## 5. Showing which test is running in the HUD

`tests/test_turning.py` also calls `POST /label` (see `docs/REST_API.md`)
with the **current test number** (`"10/15"`), shown in the Godot window
- purely a visual aid so a human watching it can tell at a glance which
scenario is currently being driven.
Standalone runs (no suite context) fall back to the start point's map-tile
number: `START_POINT_NUMBER` in `test_turning.py` maps each start point
name to that number (1 = top-left tile of the minimap, counted left-to-right
then top-to-bottom - note this is the *visual* minimap position, which is
vertically flipped from the map's internal world-grid row; see the comment
above `START_POINT_NUMBER` for why).

## 6. Other test scripts and suites

- **`tests/test_obstacles.py`** (headless pytest) - the obstacle system:
  placement validation (paved-area only; lane-direction alignment
  including corners and the roundabout ring), SAT collision geometry,
  stop-on-contact physics (full braking, no interpenetration, plus a
  high-speed approach with per-substep heading drift as regression for
  the live pass-through bug), layout save/load and map scoping, and the
  `/obstacles` REST handlers via Flask's test client. No game process needed:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_obstacles.py -q`.
- **`tests/test_road_network.py`** (headless pytest) - road network /
  smoothed geometry unit tests.
- **`scripts/verify_obstacles_live.py`** (live, REST-driven) - places a
  parked-car obstacle in the lane of the running game via `POST
  /obstacles`, drives into it, and asserts the car stops on contact
  without interpenetrating or passing through. Run against a fresh
  `python -m src.main --map basic --api` process.
- `tests/test_api.py` - basic REST API smoke tests (health check,
  control endpoints respond, etc.) - not scenario/physics testing.

## 7. Typical debugging loop

This is the actual workflow used throughout this project's development:

1. Start the sim + Godot frontend (see "Watching a run" above)
2. Run one failing scenario: `python tests/test_turning.py --only <name> <direction> <speed>`
3. Watch the Godot window while it runs, and/or inspect the printed physics
   debug output (turn planning, arc validation, off-road/teleportation
   watchdog messages - see `PhysicsValidator`, `LaneGuard` and
   `BicycleNav` in `src/`).
4. If it fails, `GET /state` polled by hand (`curl http://localhost:5000/state`)
   is usually enough to pin down *where* and *at what exact frame* things
   went wrong.
5. Fix the code, restart the game process (state like cached geometry
   is built once at startup, so a code change needs a fresh process),
   and re-run the same `--only` scenario before moving on to the full
   suite.

## 8. Parallel test runs (multiple cars)

The sim supports several cars at once (docs/MULTI_CAR_PLAN.md), so
scenarios can run in parallel instead of sequentially:

- `POST /teleport {"start_point": ..., "add": true}` spawns a car
  ALONGSIDE the existing ones (default without `add` is replace - what
  this sequential suite uses).
- Every per-car endpoint takes an optional `"uid"`: `/control`,
  `/flags`, `/label`, `/toggle` (omit = primary car, i.e. the most
  recently spawned one).
- Each car carries its own test flags + HUD label in `/state.cars[]`; the
  Godot frontend draws per-car pennants, labels and colors (red, blue,
  yellow, white by uid).
- `POST /cars {"action": "clear"}` removes all cars between rounds.
- Cars pass through each other (no car–car collisions yet - a later
  decision).

The sequential suite in §2 is unchanged: it teleports without `add`
(replace) and reads the top-level `/state` fields, which always describe
the primary car.

### The multi-car stress scenario (`fig8_stress`)

`python tests/test_turning.py --tests fig8_stress` runs a performance
probe (not a driving-correctness scenario): phases of **100 → 150 →
200 cars** on the figure-8, 30 s of SIM time each. The defaults cover the
real-time range of the sim (capacity sweep 2026-09-05: C# ceiling ~170,
Python ~90 cars - above that the sim runs in slow motion and only stretches
wall time). Add `--stress-cars N[,N...]` to run specific counts instead
(e.g. `--tests fig8_stress --stress-cars 576`). Cars are spawned evenly around
the loop via `POST /teleport {"segment": N, "progress": 0.5, "speed":
8.3, "add": true}`, hold the throttle (`/control accelerate` per uid),
then coast. Between phases the map is cleared and waited-for-empty.

The phase duration is measured in sim time (the `/state` `time` field),
NOT wall clock: at high car counts the sim may fall behind real time
(its accumulator caps substeps -> slow motion, never a leap), and a
wall-clock window would then cover less driving. A 20x wall-clock hang
guard ends a wedged phase early (at 576 cars a full phase legitimately
needs ~400 s of wall time at ~8% pace).

Per phase it stores in `tests/turning_results.json` (key
`fig8_stress|<N>cars`) the **jitter sum** (`jitters`, "Anzahl Ruckler pro
Szenario") - position jumps beyond what the car's speed can cover between
polls, plus margin - and `worst_jump_m`. Pass criteria: all cars
spawned, no crash, no off-road. Wrong-side is reported but not failing
(the lane guard has no in-turn suppression on the junction-free figure-8,
so even a perfect single car trips it occasionally).

First run (2026-09-02): **0 jitters in every phase up to 18 cars**, sim
held exactly 60 fps throughout.

## Manual visual QA scripts (no pass/fail)

These drive the running game over the REST API and set up a situation for
a human to look at in the Godot window. They are NOT part of the automated
suites above.

```bash
python3 tests/light_check.py      # one stationary car, zoomed to its lights
python3 tests/car_line_check.py   # ALL vehicle types lined up on a road,
                                  # side by side (picks a long-enough segment
                                  # itself, verifies positions vs /state)
```

## Notes / gotchas

- The game process must be restarted after any code change - there's no
  hot-reload; `--only` runs are fast specifically so this loop stays
  quick.
- `POST /reset` clears all control inputs (accelerate/brake/blinkers)
  back to `False`; `test_turning.py` calls this before every test.
- **`POST /freeze {"frozen": true}`** pauses the simulation (replaces
  the old ESC key). During an automated test run this can interact badly
  with an in-progress turn plan (a stale plan targeting nonzero speed can
  raise a teleportation-watchdog exception and kill the game process).
  Avoid freezing while a test script is actively driving.
